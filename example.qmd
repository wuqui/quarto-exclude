## Introduction

This presentation demonstrates the `exclude` Quarto extension.

## Inline exclusion

What is 6 times 7? [42]{.excl}

Who wrote *Hamlet*? [Shakespeare]{.excl}

## Block exclusion

Here's a question:

What are the three states of matter?

::: {.excl}
The three states of matter are:

1. Solid
2. Liquid
3. Gas
:::

## Section exclusion

Headers with `.excl` remove the entire section, including all content and subsections.

### Exercise

Solve the equation: 2x + 5 = 15

### Solution {.excl}

Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 10

#### Verification

Let's verify: 2(5) + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 ✓

### Next Exercise

This section appears because it's at the same level as Solution.

## RevealJS: Fragment modifier

Use `.fragment` to reveal content step-by-step:

The answer is [42]{.excl .fragment}

More content appears [here]{.excl .fragment}

## RevealJS: Slide modifier

Use `.slide` to create a new slide for excluded content:

::: {.excl .slide}
**Solution Slide**

This solution appears on its own slide when `show_excl: true`.

The `.slide` modifier creates a horizontal rule before the content.
:::

## Styling

By default, excluded content has subtle styling when shown:

- [Inline content]{.excl} has a blue underline.

::: {.excl}
Block content has a blue left border with padding.
:::

### Styled Heading {.excl}

In RevealJS, headings with `.excl` get a blue underline.

In HTML format, when a heading has `.excl`, the entire section (including all content and subsections) gets a blue left border.

## Configuration

To hide all `.excl` content:

```yaml
params:
  show_excl: false
```

To disable styling:

```yaml
params:
  show_excl: true
  excl-style:
    enabled: false
```
