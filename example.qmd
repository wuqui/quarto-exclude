## Introduction

This document demonstrates the `exclude` Quarto extension.

## Inline exclusion

What is 6 times 7? [42]{.excl}

Who wrote *Hamlet*? [Shakespeare]{.excl}

## Block exclusion

Here's a question:

What are the three states of matter?

::: {.excl}
The three states of matter are:

1. Solid
2. Liquid
3. Gas
:::

## Section exclusion

Headers with `.excl` remove the entire section, including all content and subsections.

### Exercise

Solve the equation: 2x + 5 = 15

### Solution {.excl}

Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 10

Divide by 2: x = 5

#### Verification

Let's verify: 2(5) + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 ✓

This subsection is also hidden because it's nested inside the Solution section.

### Next Exercise

This section appears because it's at the same level as Solution.

## Configuration

To hide all `.excl` content, change the YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
params:
  show_excl: false
```
